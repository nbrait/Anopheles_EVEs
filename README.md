### Abstract
Anopheles mosquitoes are not only vectors for both Plasmodium, the malaria causative agent,  and the arbovirus O'nyong-nyong, but also harbor various insect-specific viruses. During  persistent viral infections, fragments of these viral sequences can integrate into the host  genomes, forming non-retroviral endogenous viral elements (nrEVEs). Despite their relevance  to host-virus evolution and mosquito immunity, research on nrEVEs in Anopheles genomes is  limited. In this study, we screened for nrEVE in 92 publicly available Anopheles genome  assemblies, representing 39 species. We identified over 10,000 nrEVEs from 29 viral families,  primarily related to insect-specific viruses known to infect Anopheles mosquitoes. Phylogenetic  analyses of selected viral families reveal distinct lineages between EVEs in this study and  previously described Aedes-associated nrEVEs, providing evidence for insect virus-host  co-divergence within the Culicidae family. Notably, over 60% of detected viral hits belong to the  Partitiviridae family, suggesting an integration event in the ancestral lineage of Anopheles  mosquitoes, followed by duplications and the accumulation of paralogs. Additionally, nrEVE  distribution patterns across genome haplotypes show that assemblies linked to main haplotypes  exhibit higher nrEVE abundance, with variations primarily in gene duplicates. Sequencing  techniques and genome sizes also influence nrEVE detection, with greater counts observed in  larger genomes and genomes sequenced with third-generation methodologies. Overall, our  findings enhance the understanding of nrEVE landscapes in Anopheles mosquitoes and their  interactions with ancient and present-day viruses. They also highlight that technical processes  affect nrEVE detection and downstream analysis.
